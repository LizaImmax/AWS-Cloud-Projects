Step 6: Testing load balancing and automatic scaling

I will test both the web application and the automatic scaling functionality. First, I will visit the DNS name of the load balancer with the "/cafe" path to ensure that the caf√© web application loads correctly. If the application doesn't load, I will review key resources like the network configuration, NAT gateway, route tables, launch template, load balancer settings, instance deployment, and security groups to troubleshoot. Next, I will test automatic scaling by using AWS Systems Manager Session Manager to connect to a running web server instance, where I will initiate a stress test to increase the CPU load. I will monitor the Auto Scaling group to verify that it automatically deploys new instances to handle the increased load, ensuring the infrastructure scales as expected under traffic spikes. This confirms that both load balancing and auto-scaling are functioning correctly for high availability and performance.
