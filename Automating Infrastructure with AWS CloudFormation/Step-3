Step 3: Updating a Stack
In step 3, I updated the lab-application stack using AWS CloudFormation to modify the security group settings. First, I reviewed the current inbound rules for the security group in the EC2 console, confirming that only HTTP traffic was allowed.

Next, I downloaded the updated CloudFormation template (lab-application2.yaml), which included a new rule to allow HTTPS traffic on port 443. Returning to CloudFormation, I selected lab-application, chose Update, and replaced the existing template with the new file. After reviewing the Change Set Preview, which confirmed that only the security group would be modified (without replacement), I submitted the update.

Once the stack reached UPDATE_COMPLETE, I verified the change by checking the Inbound rules in the EC2 Security Groups list. The new rule allowing HTTPS (TCP port 443) was successfully added.

This step demonstrated how AWS CloudFormation enables repeatable, version-controlled infrastructure updates with minimal manual intervention. By storing templates in a source code repository like AWS CodeCommit, I can maintain a history of changes, making infrastructure updates efficient and trackable.
