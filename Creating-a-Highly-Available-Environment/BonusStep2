Bonus Step 2: Configuring a highly available NAT gateway


I improve the application's resilience by making the NAT gateway highly available. Since the application servers run in private subnets, they require a NAT gateway in a public subnet to access the internet. Previously, there was only one NAT gateway, creating a single point of failure. To address this, I deploy a second NAT gateway in another Availability Zone and configure a new route table to direct internet-bound traffic from the corresponding private subnet. This ensures that even if one Availability Zone fails, the servers in the other zone can still access the internet, enhancing the systemâ€™s fault tolerance.
