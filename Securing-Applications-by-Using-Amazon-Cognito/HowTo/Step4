Task 4: Updating the application to use the user pool for authentication





So far, you have created the Amazon Cognito user pool, configured it with information about the web application, and created a user. However, the Birds application isn't set up with authentication yet because the application doesn't know about Amazon Cognito.

In this task, you update the application to provide the information it requires to interact with Amazon Cognito. This information includes the user pool ID, application client ID, and Amazon Cognito domain prefix. 

Return to the browser tab with the AWS Cloud9 IDE.

In the terminal, to stop the node server, press Ctrl+C.

Next, you update the config.js file to add your Amazon Cognito user pool information to the website code.

In the explorer to the left of the terminal, expand the website/scripts folder.

Open the config.js file.

In the file, to uncomment the following lines of code, remove the two forward slashes (//) from the beginning of each line.

//CONFIG.COGNITO_DOMAIN_STR = "<cognito-domain>";
//CONFIG.COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID_STR = "<cognito-user-pool-id>";
//CONFIG.COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID_STR = "<cognito-app-client-id>";
//CONFIG.CLOUDFRONT_DISTRO_STR = "<cloudfront-distribution>";
In this code, replace each placeholder with the following values that you saved into your text editor:

  Note: Update the values for only the following parameters. Replace the entire string, including the brackets (<>).






  <cognito-domain>: Use the value for Amazon Cognito domain prefix.

<cognito-user-pool-id>: Use the value for User pool ID.

<cognito-app-client-id>: Use the value for App client ID.

<cloudfront-distribution>: In the value for CloudFront distribution domain, use only the prefix before .cloudfront.net (for example, d123456acbdef).

The updated code should be similar to the following:

CONFIG.COGNITO_DOMAIN_STR = "abc-10-12-2021";
CONFIG.COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID_STR = "us-east-1_AAAA1111";
CONFIG.COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID_STR = "1a1a1a12b2b2b2b3c3c3c3c";
CONFIG.CLOUDFRONT_DISTRO_STR = "d123456acbdef";
To save the file, choose File > Save.

Next, you push the updated website code to the S3 bucket.

In the AWS Cloud9 IDE terminal, enter the following command, and replace <s3-bucket> with the name of the S3 bucket. Run your revised command.

   cd /home/ec2-user/environment
   aws s3 cp website s3://<s3-bucket>/ --recursive --cache-control "max-age=0"
To update the node server files, run the following commands:

Note: These commands update the JavaScript packages required for the application to use the Amazon Cognito user pool, along with other configuration changes made earlier.

cd /home/ec2-user/environment/node_server
cp package2.json package.json
cp libs/mw2.js libs/mw.js
Next, you update the package.json file to add the Amazon Cognito user pool information to the node server.

In the explorer window to the left of the terminal, expand the node_server folder.

Open the package.json file.

Replace <cognito_user_pool_id> with the User pool ID from your text file.

  The updated line should be similar to the following:

"start": "REGION_STR=us-east-1 USER_POOL_ID_STR=us-east-1_AAAA1111 node index.js"
56.. To save the file, choose File > Save.
