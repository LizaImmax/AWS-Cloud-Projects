Step 6: Configuring the Identity Pool
In this step, I configure the Amazon Cognito identity pool to work with the Birds application. I begin by navigating to the Identity pools section in the Amazon Cognito console and selecting the bird_app_id_pool link. I then copy the Identity Pool ID and save it in my text editor for future reference.

Next, I add Amazon Cognito as the identity provider by selecting the bird_app user pool and the bird_app_client application client. In the Role settings section, I ensure the Default authenticated role is selected. This role is assigned to users after they log in. I save the changes and review the Authenticated access section, where I confirm that the authenticated role is configured with the default role, which will be used for all authenticated users. This step sets up secure and controlled access to the application for authenticated users using the assigned IAM role.
