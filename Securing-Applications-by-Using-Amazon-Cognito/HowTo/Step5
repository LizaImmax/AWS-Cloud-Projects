Step 5 Summary: Testing the User Pool Integration with the Application
In this step, I tested the updated Birds application to ensure that the integration with the Amazon Cognito user pool was working properly. First, I restarted the node server to apply the updated configuration by running the command npm start. Afterward, I returned to the browser tab with the Birds application and refreshed the page.

I navigated to the SIGHTINGS page, but instead of seeing the list of bird sightings, I was prompted for authentication because the application now requires login to access protected content. I logged in with the credentials for testuser, and after successfully logging in, I was able to see the bird listings. If I was redirected to the home page, I simply navigated back to the SIGHTINGS page. This confirmed that the user pool integration was functioning correctly, as only authenticated users could access protected pages.

Next, I tested the role-based access control by navigating to the SITEADMIN page. I was prompted to log in as an administrator to access the admin page. After logging in with the admin credentials, I successfully accessed the SITEADMIN page, where a message stating "Admin page under construction" was displayed. This proved that the Amazon Cognito user pool could manage role-based access and securely control who could access different parts of the application based on their role.
