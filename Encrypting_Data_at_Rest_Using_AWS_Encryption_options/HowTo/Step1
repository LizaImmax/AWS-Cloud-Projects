In this step, I reviewed the default encryption settings of an Amazon S3 bucket and verified that server-side encryption (SSE-S3) was enabled. I then uploaded an image file (clock.png) to the bucket, granting public-read access to test accessibility. After uploading, I examined the encryption settings of the file and confirmed that Amazon S3 automatically encrypts data at rest. Finally, I accessed the image via its public URL, where Amazon S3 transparently decrypted the object for display in the browser.
