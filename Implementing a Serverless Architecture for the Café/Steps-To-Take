Steps I Took to Automate Sales Reporting for Frank & Marthaâ€™s CafÃ© â˜•ðŸš€
Step 1: Understanding the Problem
Frank & Martha were manually analyzing daily sales dataâ€”time-consuming and inefficient. They needed an automated serverless solution to generate and email sales reports.

Step 2: Setting Up the Data Extraction Lambda
âœ… Created security groups for the Lambda function and updated RDS security rules to allow access.
âœ… Deployed salesAnalysisReportDataExtractor Lambda function to extract sales data from Amazon RDS.
âœ… Configured private subnets for secure database connectivity.
âœ… Set memory to 128MB and timeout to 30 seconds.
âœ… Uploaded and tested the Python code (debugging included, of course! ðŸ˜†).

Step 3: Creating the Sales Analysis Report Lambda
âœ… Created salesAnalysisReport Lambda function to generate and email daily sales insights.
âœ… Set Python 3.11 runtime, uploaded the function, and configured the handler.
âœ… Allocated 128MB memory and set timeout to 30 seconds.

Step 4: Setting Up Amazon SNS for Email Notifications
âœ… Created an SNS topic (SalesReportTopic) to handle email alerts.
âœ… Updated the salesAnalysisReport Lambda to use the SNS topicâ€™s ARN as an environment variable.

Step 5: Subscribing to the SNS Topic
âœ… Added email subscribers (Frank & Martha).
âœ… Confirmed the email subscriptionâ€”because if they donâ€™t confirm, no reports for them! ðŸ˜†

Step 6: Testing the Sales Analysis Report Lambda
âœ… Created a test event in Lambda (hello-world style).
âœ… Ran the functionâ€”checked for email delivery.
âœ… Debugged security group, timeout, and handler issues via CloudWatch Logs.

Step 7: Automating the Report with EventBridge
âœ… Created an EventBridge rule to trigger salesAnalysisReport Lambda every day at 8 PM UTC+3.
âœ… Used an AWS cron expression to schedule the task.
âœ… Assigned mySchedulerRole to handle execution.

Final Result?
ðŸ“© Frank & Martha now receive automated sales reports daily, allowing them to focus on brewing the best coffee instead of crunching numbers! â˜•ðŸ“Š
